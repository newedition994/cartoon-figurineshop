# Cartoon Figurineshop - React.js Project

# Background

I have used Ruby on Rails to initiate the API for my figurine database and I use POSTGRESql to store the database. From there I create my client-side element using React.js. The Web applicaiton lists some Funko Pop figurines from various shows and movies. Users can see what each figurine looks like plus the names, price and the size of each Figurine. A user can also add to the database by switching routes to the create a figurine button.
